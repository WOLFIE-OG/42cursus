Description: Minitalk is a project that involves implementing a small client-server program for inter-process communication using signals. It allows two processes to communicate with each other by sending and receiving messages.

### Ft_printf

Ft_printf is a project to re-implement the printf function in C.

[![Ft_printf Build](https://github.com/WOLFIE-OG/ft_printf/actions/workflows/makefile.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/WOLFIE-OG/ft_printf/actions/workflows/makefile.yml)

Description: Ft_printf is a project that involves re-implementing the printf function in C. The goal is to replicate the functionality of printf, allowing formatted output to be printed to the console or other output streams.

### Get_next_line

Get_next_line is a function to read lines from a file descriptor.

[![Get_next_line Build](https://github.com/WOLFIE-OG/get_next_line/actions/workflows/makefile.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/WOLFIE-OG/get_next_line/actions/workflows/makefile.yml)

Description: Get_next_line is a project that involves implementing a function to read lines from a file descriptor. The function reads from the file descriptor until a newline character is encountered, allowing lines to be read sequentially from files or other input sources.
